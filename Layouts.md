# Layouts in Android

Layout basically refers to the arrangement of elements on a page these elements are likely to be images

## Types of Layouts (Commonly used)
- `LinearLayout`: All child components in one horizontal or vertial direction
- `RelativeLayout`: Used to specify the position of child components relative to each other
- `ConstraintLayout`: Just like how child components in relative layout can be positioned relative to each other, contraint layout can position itself relative to other components (not to its child though)
- `TableLayout`: Arrange groups of views into rows and columns
- `FrameLayout`: desinged to block out an area on the screen to display a single item. Generally should be used to hold a single child view because it can be difficult to organize child views in a way that's scalable to different screen sizes without the children overlapping each other.
- `AbsoluteLayout`: Lets you specifies the exact position using x and y coordinates of its children.
- `WebView`: A view that displays webpages. In most cases, it is recommended that we use a standard web browser to deliver content to the user.
- `ListView`: Basically displays data in the form of a scrolling list
- `GridView`: Displays data in two-dimensional scrolling grid
